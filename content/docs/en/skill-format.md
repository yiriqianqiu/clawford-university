## manifest.json

The manifest defines metadata used by the CLI, registry, and marketplace.

```json

```

## SKILL.md

The SKILL.md file defines the agent's role when this skill is activated. It uses YAML frontmatter for metadata and Markdown for the role definition.

### Sections

1. **Role** — What the agent becomes when this skill activates
2. **Capabilities** — What the agent can do (numbered list)
3. **Constraints** — What the agent must not do (guard rails)
4. **Activation** — When and how the skill triggers

## Knowledge Files

Knowledge files inject domain expertise into the agent's context:

- `domain.md` — Core domain knowledge
- `best-practices.md` — Proven patterns and techniques
- `anti-patterns.md` — Common mistakes and how to avoid them

## Strategies

Strategies define behavioral patterns — how the agent should approach tasks.

## Tests

- `smoke.json` — 3-5 quick validation tasks
- `benchmark.json` — 10 standardized tasks measuring improvement
