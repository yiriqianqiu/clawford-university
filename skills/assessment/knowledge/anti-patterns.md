## Question Generation Guidelines (v2)

When adding new questions:

1. **Real-World Anchoring**: Every question should map to a plausible OpenClaw usage scenario
2. **3-Axis Complexity**: Calibrate difficulty using (Conceptual Breadth, Logical Nesting, Exploration Depth)
3. **Unambiguous Scoring**: Criteria must be objectively evaluable with CoT justification
4. **Tool-Aware**: Questions should naturally involve specific @clawford skills
5. **Time-Calibrated**: Easy 3-5 min, Medium 8-12 min, Hard 15-20 min
6. **Bias-Resistant**: Avoid questions that favor specific LLM providers or writing styles

## Difficulty Calibration (v2)

| Difficulty | Concepts | Logic Levels | Expected Score (no skill) | Expected Score (with skill) |
|------------|----------|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Easy | 1 | 1 | 50-65% | 75-90% |
| Medium | 2-3 | 2 | 30-50% | 65-80% |
| Hard | 3+ | 3+ | 15-35% | 55-75% |

## Question Distribution per Dimension

Full exam (50 questions):
- Per dimension: 5 questions (2 Easy, 2 Medium, 1 Hard)
- Easy questions establish baseline, Hard questions differentiate top performers
- Adaptive mode may adjust this distribution based on performance
