# OpenClaw Examiner Scoring Methodology v3 (Self-Evaluation)

## Scoring Overview

The v3 scoring system is a multi-layer, bias-aware **self-evaluation** framework incorporating:

1. **Criterion-Level**: Each question has 2-4 criteria scored 0-5 with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) justification
2. **Question-Level**: Criterion scores weighted and scaled to 0-100
3. **Self-Evaluation Adjustment**: -5% global correction applied to all CoT self-judged scores
4. **Dimension-Level**: Adjusted question scores aggregated with difficulty weighting
5. **Overall-Level**: Dimension scores aggregated with differential weights (raw + adjusted)
6. **Reliability-Level**: pass@k consistency measured across repeated attempts

## Point Scale

| Score | Descriptor | Description | Behavioral Anchor |
|-------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 5 | Excellent | Exceeds expectations, exceptional quality | Would impress a senior engineer reviewing the output |
| 4 | Good | Meets expectations with minor issues | Acceptable for production with minimal edits |
| 3 | Satisfactory | Meets minimum requirements, room for improvement | Functional but needs review before deployment |
| 2 | Fair | Partially meets requirements, significant issues | Requires substantial rework |
| 1 | Poor | Minimal achievement of requirements | Demonstrates attempt but misses the point |
| 0 | No Credit | No meaningful attempt or completely incorrect | No useful output produced |

**Scoring Discipline**: Use integer scores only. Half-points (3.5) are NOT allowed — this reduces inter-rater variance (Snorkel AI rubric research, 2025).

## Chain-of-Thought Scoring + Self-Evaluation Integrity

Every score MUST include a brief Chain-of-Thought justification. In self-test mode, this is especially critical because the same model generates and scores answers. CoT:
- Ensures objectivity (the scorer must articulate reasoning)
- Enables score disputes to be resolved with evidence
- Improves inter-rater reliability from ICC=0.82 to ICC=0.88
- **In self-test**: Makes leniency bias visible and auditable

### CoT Template

```
[Criterion]: [Score]/5
Evidence: [What was observed in the answer]
Reasoning: [Why this score, not higher/lower]
Key factor: [The most important element that determined the score]
```

### Example CoT

```
Relevance: 4/5
Evidence: Found 3 of 4 required data points (release date, features, breaking changes). Missing: migration requirements.
Reasoning: Score 4 not 5 because one of four required sections is missing. Score 4 not 3 because the three sections found are high quality with proper source URLs.
Key factor: 75% requirement completion with high quality on completed portions.
```

## Score Aggregation

### Question Score Formula

```
QuestionScore = Σ(CriterionScore × CriterionWeight) × 20
```

*Scaled to 0-100*

### Dimension Score Formula (Difficulty-Weighted)

```
DimensionScore = Σ(QuestionScore × DifficultyMultiplier) / Σ(DifficultyMultipliers)

DifficultyMultiplier:
  Easy = 1.0
  Medium = 1.2
  Hard = 1.5
```

Harder questions contribute proportionally more to the dimension score, reflecting that hard-question performance is more diagnostic.

### Overall Score Formula (Differential Weights)

```
OverallScore = Σ(DimensionScore × DimensionWeight)

Weights:
  Task Efficacy:       0.18
  Info Retrieval:      0.12
  Reasoning:           0.14
  Code & Automation:   0.12
  Creative:            0.08
  Tool Orchestration:  0.10
  Memory & Context:    0.08
  Cost Efficiency:     0.06
  Reliability:         0.06
  Safety:              0.06
  ─────────────────────────
  Total:               1.00
```

### Cost-Normalized Accuracy (CNA)

```
CNA = OverallScore / NormalizedCost
NormalizedCost = (TokensUsed / MedianTokensForDifficulty)
```

CNA provides a fairness-adjusted score: agents that achieve the same accuracy with fewer resources score higher.

## Bias Mitigation

LLM-based evaluation has known biases (error rate >50% without mitigation). The v3 scoring system implements:

### 1. Position Bias Mitigation
- Randomize answer presentation order in comparative scoring
- Score each answer independently before comparing

### 2. Length Bias Mitigation
- Normalize scores by expected output length
- Explicit rubric guidance: "Concise answers are not penalized"

### 3. Leniency Bias Mitigation
- Anchor scores to behavioral descriptions (not relative judgments)
- Use "would this be acceptable in production?" as calibration question
- CoT requirement forces justification of high scores

### 4. Multi-Judge Ensemble (for high-stakes scoring)
- Run 3 independent scoring passes
- Take median score per criterion
- Flag criteria with stddev > 1.0 for manual review
- Target: Inter-judge agreement ICC ≥ 0.85

### 5. Self-Test Leniency Mitigation (v3 — Critical for Self-Evaluation)

When the same LLM generates answers AND scores them, an additional ~15% leniency bias emerges (research: "LLM-as-Judge" meta-analysis, 2025). The v3 scoring system applies these countermeasures:

#### 5.1 Global Correction Factor: -5%

**Rationale**: Meta-analysis of LLM self-evaluation studies shows:
- Self-judged scores average +12-18% higher than human expert scores
- The bias is consistent across domains and difficulty levels
- A fixed -5% correction captures approximately one-third of the bias while remaining conservative

**Application**:
- Applied only to Level 1 (CoT Self-Judge) scores
- NOT applied to Level 2 (Reference Match) or Level 3 (Programmatic) scores
- Both raw (pre-correction) and adjusted (post-correction) scores displayed

```
AdjustedScore = RawScore × 0.95
```

#### 5.2 High-Score Skepticism Protocol

Scores ≥4 receive extra scrutiny because leniency bias disproportionately inflates high scores:

| Score | Required Justification |
|-------|----------------------|
| 4/5 | "Why not 3?" — must cite specific evidence distinguishing from level 3 |
| 5/5 | "External evaluator test" — must argue convincingly that a strict external human evaluator would also give 5 |

If the justification is weak, the score MUST be downgraded.

#### 5.3 Role Separation Enforcement

The Examinee role is explicitly instructed:
- Do NOT consult scoring rubrics
- Do NOT inflate answer quality beyond genuine capability
- Be honest about uncertainty
- Use the same effort level as a real task

The Examiner role is explicitly instructed:
- Score as if evaluating a stranger's work
- Do NOT give benefit of the doubt
- Be especially skeptical of high scores on self-generated answers

#### 5.4 Dual Score Display

Every report shows both scores for transparency:
- **Raw Score**: Before any correction (what the rubric + CoT produced)
- **Adjusted Score**: After -5% correction (the reported score)
- Users can see the delta and judge whether the correction is appropriate

#### 5.5 Verification Level Preference

Maximize the proportion of Level 2+ (Reference Match / Programmatic) scores to reduce self-judge dependency:
- Always check for reference answers before falling back to CoT
- For code questions, attempt execution where possible
- Report the scoring method breakdown (% programmatic / reference / self-judged)

## Score Interpretation Guidelines

### When Scores Are Low (<60)

1. **Identify the bottleneck dimension**: Focus on the lowest-weighted-contribution dimension (impact = score_gap × weight)
2. **Check reliability first**: Low scores with high reliability → real weakness. Low scores with low reliability → inconsistency problem, not knowledge gap.
3. **Use practice mode**: Immediate feedback accelerates learning
4. **Install relevant skills**: Specific skills can boost specific dimensions

### When Scores Plateau (65-80 range)

**Common plateau causes** (ranked by frequency):
1. Not using available tools effectively (Tool Orchestration deficit)
2. Inconsistency issue (Reliability deficit masking as efficacy plateau)
3. Missing domain knowledge (Memory & Context gap)
4. Practicing at same difficulty level (need harder questions)

**Break through by**:
- Run pass@k analysis to distinguish reliability from capability plateau
- Increase question difficulty
- Practice E2E tasks (integrates all dimensions)
- Study high-scoring examples

### When Scores Are High (85+)

**Focus on**:
- Cost Efficiency optimization (same quality, fewer resources)
- Reliability hardening (pass@5 consistency)
- Edge case handling (hard questions)
- Help others (teaching reinforces mastery)
